Task 102

""""
This function takes two arguments, a and b, which are the same as the LOAD_FAST instructions in the bytecode. It then computes a ** b using the BINARY_POWER instruction and assigns the result to a new variable x. The value 98 is loaded using the LOAD_CONST instruction and assigned to the variable y. The BINARY_ADD instruction is then used to add x and y together, and the result is returned using the RETURN_VALUE instruction.

Thus, the function magic_calculation computes the same result as the given Python bytecode.
